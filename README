So Hi,
I am Aryan Arya from CSE branch.
I'm from gwalior MP and currently residing in brahma hostel.
My hobbies include playing badminton, watching sitcoms , listening songs and Acting(dramatics).
Trying to explore new things in this campus to find where my interest takes me...

I want to contribute to open source becasue i like my work to be shared across the globe and it alson gives me opportunity to look at others' code and improve myself.
